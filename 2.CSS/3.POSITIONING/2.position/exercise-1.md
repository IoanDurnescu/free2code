# Position properties

### Before we start

Before we start with these exercises, I want you to take a good look in the documentation, and search for the term `position`.
Take a good read to see what the difference are and what it exactly does.

Please take your time with this! It is important to know the basics about this.

### Set up

Copy the following code in your editor:

```html
<html>
<head>
 <meta charset="utf-8" />
 <style>
     body{
         height:3600px;
         padding:0;
         margin:0;
         font-family:sans-serif;
         }
     h2{
         margin:0;
         padding-top:500px;
         text-align:center;
         }
/* Put your styling here */
</style>
</head>
<body>
    <nav>
    <!--Please make your own navbar here!-->
    </nav>
    <section>
        <h2>Please scroll down!</h2>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>The navbar should still be visible down here!</h2>
    </section>
</body>
</html>
```

### On the job

As a refreshment of everything we have currently seen so far. I want you to re-create this simpel navbar.

After this, find a way to let the navbar stick to the top of the screen.
