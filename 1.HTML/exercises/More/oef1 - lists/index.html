            Don't we all <em>love</em> lists...<br/> They exist in all kinds of types; we devided them into three main sections: <a href="pages/personal.html">personal lists</a>, <a href="pages/practical.html">practical lists</a> and at last of course our <a href="pages/dreamlists.html">dreamlists</a>!<br/>
            <br/>
            Personal lists maybe are the most familar lists, we already made them since we were a child. They consider personal matter, such as your favorite food or hobby's, ...<br/>
            <br/>
            When you have a busy life, practical lists can help you big time! As soon as you think you have too many tasks to do, sit down and make that list! It will help you having an overview on the different jobs. The most important or urgent tasks can than be
            seperated from the less important or urgent ones.<br/><br/>

            And last but not least, there are our dreamlists! Everybody should have them, it is of a high importance to keep dreaming! Live your dream, but be aware that some dreams maybe just are made to dream on...
