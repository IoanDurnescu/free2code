# Exercise 5 - Lists

Open the index.html file and compare the html code to the output of the document. 
Identify the 3 different types of lists: ordered, unordered and definition lists. Make sure to check the documentation of these html tags!
In the `<body>` element, add one list of each type with your own content underneath the example lists.
