## File Extension

Your computer knows what application to use to open a certain file by checking the extension of the file. Some examples are:
 
- Documents ending in **.docx** will be openend by **Microsoft Word** 
- Documents ending in **.pdf** will be opened with a **pdf reader**
- A file ending in **.mp3** will be opened with a **music player**
 
When you write HTML code, you want your code to be read by the **browser**. Your computer will automatically open all files ending in **.html** in the browser. The browser will then convert the HTML code inside the document to a human-readable webpage.

If you want to view the pure HTML code, you will have to use a different application to open these documents.

### Code editors

You could use the default text editor that's installed on your computer to write your HTML files. On Windows for example that's Notepad. That would work perfectly fine as long as you don't write any errors in your HTML code and save it as a **.html** file. 

There are also applications created specifically to write code. These applications have built-in functionalities such as code highlighting, indentation of your code, autocomplete, etc.
